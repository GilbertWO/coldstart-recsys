# coldstart-recsys
Recommendation engine (ALS + learning-to-rank) trained on real e-commerce transactions, served via Spring Boot + Redis, with explicit cold-start handling for new users.

## Dataset
[H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) — 1,371,980 registered customers, 31,788,324 transactions in `transactions_train.csv`.

## EDA Findings

**1. User-level cold start is the dominant case, not an edge case.**
19.58% of all 1,371,980 registered customers — including 9,699 (0.71%) who registered but never made a single purchase — have fewer than 3 purchases in the training window. Repeat-purchase rate (customers with more than 1 purchase) is 89.71%. Cold-start handling has to be a first-class part of the design, not a fallback bolted on afterward.

**2. Item-level imbalance mirrors the user-level problem.**
The top 3 product categories out of 19 (Garment Upper body, Garment Lower body, Garment Full body) account for 72.83% of all transactions, while the bottom 9 categories combined represent under 1%. 5,486 articles (5.20% of the catalog) have zero or one purchase. A naive popularity-based baseline will be dominated by upper-body garments, and item-level cold start (new or rarely-purchased articles) needs the same deliberate handling as user-level cold start.
